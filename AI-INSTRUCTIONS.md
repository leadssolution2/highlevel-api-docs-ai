# AI-INSTRUCTIONS — GoHighLevel API V2

**Read this file first.** It is the single source of truth for any AI agent generating code, designing integrations, or answering questions about the GoHighLevel (HighLevel / LeadConnector) API in this repository.

---

## 1. Hard rules (do not violate)

1. **API V2 only.** V1 is end-of-life. Do **not** generate, suggest, or "preserve compatibility with" V1 endpoints, V1 auth headers, or `services.leadconnectorhq.com/v1/*` paths. If you find V1 code, flag it for replacement.
2. **Base URL is `https://services.leadconnectorhq.com`.** Every V2 request goes here. The old `rest.gohighlevel.com` host is V1 and is dead.
3. **Every V2 request requires the `Version` header.** Use `Version: 2021-07-28` unless a specific endpoint's reference page in `docs/` says otherwise. Missing this header is the #1 cause of silent 401s.
4. **`Accept: application/json`** is required on every request.
5. **Never invent fields.** If a field is not in this repo's OpenAPI/markdown source, it does not exist. Webhook payloads in particular are minimal — the AI must look up the actual event schema, not infer it from the contact object shape.
6. **Stoplight links are dead.** Any `highlevel.stoplight.io` URL the user pastes should be treated as deprecated; use the markdown / OpenAPI in this repo instead.

## 2. Authentication — pick one, commit to it

There are two auth models. They are **not** interchangeable. Decide before writing any code.

### Private Integration Token (PIT) — single account / internal use
- Use when: building for one HighLevel sub-account (one Location), internal automation, single-tenant tool.
- How: User generates a PIT inside their HighLevel sub-account settings. Token is long-lived.
- Header: `Authorization: Bearer <PIT>`
- Scope: bound to the Location it was created in. Cannot cross Locations.
- **Default to this for single-client work.** It is dramatically simpler than OAuth and is the right call ~80% of the time.

### OAuth 2.0 — marketplace apps / multi-tenant
- Use when: many different HighLevel customers will install / connect your app to their own accounts.
- Flow: standard OAuth 2.0 authorization code grant. Tokens expire — you **must** implement refresh.
- Header: `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`
- Token types: Location-level token (acts on one sub-account) vs Company-level token (Agency level, can mint Location tokens).
- Reference: `docs/oauth/` in this repo, plus https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/docs/oauth/Overview and https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/docs/oauth/Faqs/index.html

**Up-front question for the AI to ask the user if it isn't told:** "Is this for one HighLevel account (PIT) or a marketplace app many customers will install (OAuth)?" Do not start coding until this is answered.

## 3. Rate limits — bake these in from line one

Per app, per resource (a "resource" = one Location, or one Company for Agency-level calls):

| Limit | Value |
|---|---|
| Burst | **100 requests / 10 seconds** |
| Daily | **200,000 requests / day** |

**Response headers to read on every request:**
- `X-RateLimit-Limit-Daily`
- `X-RateLimit-Daily-Remaining`
- `X-RateLimit-Interval-Milliseconds`
- `X-RateLimit-Max`
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining`

**Rules for AI-generated code:**
- Never write a naive `for contact in contacts: requests.post(...)` loop. Add a token-bucket / sliding-window limiter sized to the burst limit.
- On `429`, back off exponentially and respect any `Retry-After` header.
- For bulk operations, prefer batch endpoints where they exist (see `docs/` for which resources support bulk).
- Log the remaining-quota headers when getting close to the daily cap so the human operator sees it before it hits zero.

## 4. Where to find what — repo map

| Path | What's in it |
|---|---|
| `docs/marketplace modules/` | Per-resource markdown reference (Contacts, Conversations, Calendars, Opportunities, Locations, Custom Fields, Workflows, Payments, Users, Forms/Surveys, etc.). **Start here for any endpoint question.** |
| `docs/oauth/` | OAuth flow, scopes, token refresh, FAQ |
| `docs/webhook events/` | Webhook event payloads. **Critical:** event payloads do **not** include the full contact object — only the fields documented here. |
| `docs/country list/` | Country/locale codes used by location & contact endpoints |
| `models/` | OpenAPI schemas (machine-readable). Prefer these for type generation. |
| `apps/` | Per-product API specs |
| `common/` | Shared schema fragments referenced by multiple endpoints |
| `toc.json` | Table of contents — useful for finding the right page programmatically |

**When asked about an endpoint:** read the markdown in `docs/marketplace modules/<resource>/` AND cross-check the OpenAPI in `models/` or `apps/`. The markdown is human-readable; the OpenAPI is authoritative for exact field names and types.

---

## 5. Resource quick-reference (what each major area does)

- **Contacts** — CRUD on people. Custom fields live here. Tag operations are sub-endpoints of a contact.
- **Conversations** — SMS, email, IG/FB DM, WhatsApp threads. One Conversation = one channel with one contact.
- **Calendars** — appointments, calendar groups, free-slot lookup, calendar resources.
- **Opportunities** — pipeline stages, deal records. Opportunity custom fields are **separate** from contact custom fields.
- **Locations** — sub-accounts (one HighLevel customer = one Location). Most endpoints scope to a `locationId`.
- **Custom Fields** — schema definitions. Read these before writing any contact/opportunity that sets custom field values; you need the field's `id`, not its display name.
- **Workflows** — trigger workflows externally, list workflows. Cannot edit workflow definitions via API.
- **Payments** — invoices, orders, transactions, subscriptions, products.
- **Users** — Agency users and sub-account users. Different endpoints.
- **Forms / Surveys** — submissions and definitions.
- **Webhooks** — register subscriptions, view events. See section 7.

## 6. Common gotchas (each one has burned somebody)

1. **`Version` header missing → 401.** Not "invalid version" — just 401. Easy to mistake for an auth problem.
2. **Custom field IDs, not names.** When writing a contact, `customFields` takes `[{id, field_value}]`, not `{fieldName: value}`.
3. **Contact custom fields ≠ Opportunity custom fields.** Different endpoints, different field IDs, different scopes. Do not pass one where the other is expected.
4. **Phone numbers must be E.164.** `+15555551234`. Anything else gets silently rejected or normalised in surprising ways.
5. **`locationId` is mandatory on most writes.** Even when the token is Location-scoped. Pass it explicitly.
6. **Pagination is cursor-based on most list endpoints**, not offset/limit. Read the response's `meta` block; do not assume `?page=2` works.
7. **Webhook payloads are minimal.** A `ContactCreate` event gives you an ID and a few key fields, not the full contact. If you need more, follow up with `GET /contacts/{id}`.
8. **OAuth Location tokens vs Company tokens** — calling a Location-scoped endpoint with a Company token (or vice versa) gives confusing 403s. Mint the right token type for the call.
9. **Tag operations are not idempotent in the way you'd expect.** Adding an existing tag is a no-op (good); removing a non-existent tag returns success (also good); but bulk tag writes don't dedupe — sending the same tag twice creates two attempts.
10. **`startDate` / `endDate` are Unix ms timestamps in calendar endpoints, ISO-8601 strings elsewhere.** Always check the schema; do not assume.
11. **Every response wraps its payload in `results`.** The shape is `{success, statusCode, message, results:{…}, traceId}`. Parse `resp.results.<thing>` — `results.posts` (+ `results.count`) on list endpoints, `results.post` (id = `results.post._id`) on create, `results.accounts`, `results.csv`. Reading the top level (`resp.posts` / `resp.post` / `resp.accounts`) silently returns nothing, not an error. This exact mistake hid 60 in-review social posts and made an auto-approve a no-op (2026-06-23) — the operator was told "nothing's published" while 60 sat in the queue. **Dump the raw JSON before writing any parser**, and on a create grab `results.<obj>._id` immediately.
12. **Social-planner `posts/list` only surfaces composer/CSV-created posts — NOT API-created ones.** A post created via `POST /social-media-posting/{loc}/posts` will never appear in `posts/list` (any `type`), and `GET /posts` is 404. So capture its `_id` from the create response or it can only be managed from the planner UI. Also `posts/list` `type:scheduled` is date-windowed (far-future scheduled posts don't show without a date range), and its `platform` field is unreliable — trust `accountIds`. To approve a queued post via API: `PUT /posts/{id}` with `status:'scheduled'` (body must include `media:[]` + accountIds/summary/type/scheduleDate/userId).

## 7. Webhooks — read before generating any handler

- **Subscribe** via the API (see `docs/marketplace modules/` webhook section) or via the marketplace app config.
- **Verify the signature.** HighLevel signs webhook requests; reject any request whose signature doesn't validate. The signing secret is the app's secret (OAuth) or a webhook-specific secret (PIT-scoped webhooks).
- **Payload shape:** event-specific. **Do not assume a contact-create webhook contains the full contact.** Look up the exact event in `docs/webhook events/` before parsing.
- **Idempotency:** events can be redelivered. Use the event ID (or a `(type, resourceId, timestamp)` tuple) as a dedupe key.
- **Respond fast.** 200 quickly, then process async. HighLevel will retry on timeouts and that compounds your rate-limit usage.

---

## 8. When generating code

- Use a real HTTP client with retry + backoff (e.g. `httpx` + `tenacity` in Python, `got` + `p-retry` in Node). Never raw `fetch`/`requests` in a loop.
- Centralise the auth header, base URL, and `Version` header in one client wrapper so they cannot be forgotten on individual calls.
- Type the responses against the OpenAPI in `models/`. Generated types beat hand-typed dicts.
- Log the `traceId` / `requestId` returned by the API on every error response — HighLevel support cannot help without it.
- Pin the API version (`2021-07-28`). Do not switch versions mid-project without the user's explicit approval.

---

## 9. When in doubt

- **Look at the markdown in `docs/`** — it is the rendered marketplace docs, frozen as files. Authoritative.
- **Look at the OpenAPI in `models/` and `apps/`** — authoritative for schemas.
- If neither has the answer, the live docs are at https://marketplace.gohighlevel.com/docs/ and the developer hub at https://developers.gohighlevel.com/. Treat the *current* live docs as more recent than this repo if there is a conflict — but only if the human operator confirms.
- For ambiguous behaviour, ask the human. Do not invent.

## 9b. Automation Workflows (the in-app builder, not the API)

Building **workflow automations** (triggers/actions in the GHL builder UI, the Workflow AI "Build" mode, Custom Webhook retry patterns)? Read **`docs/automations/WORKFLOW-BUILDER-PLAYBOOK.md`** in this repo first. Highlights: drive the Workflow AI one node per message; its "Complete these steps" checklist is the designed human handoff; Custom Webhook saves `status` even on 4xx/5xx (branch `status Is 200` → success, everything else → bounded retry with a Counter field + native Math Operation); manual enrolls SKIP Custom Webhook actions; never ship an unbounded Go-To loop.
